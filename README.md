# Retail Analytics Platform

## Business Problem

Online retail companies generate large volumes of transactional data across customers,
products, and time. Deriving reliable insights is challenging due to data quality issues,
cancellations, returns, and lack of analytics-ready structures.

This project builds an end-to-end analytics platform that transforms raw transactional
retail data into structured, analytics-ready tables to support decision-making such as
revenue tracking, customer behavior analysis, and trend identification.
